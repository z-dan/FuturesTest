# FuturesTest
A simple test program to investigate futures introduced in C++11.

This program consists of a single source file that computes primes by performing the computations asynchronously and receiving the results using std::future.

In and of itself, not very useful. It is intended merely as an example of C++ threading using std::future and std::async.
